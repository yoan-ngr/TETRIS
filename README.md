Project TETRIS
============

**[Version française ici !](https://github.com/yoan-ngr/TETRIS/README_FR.md)**

General presentation
----------

TETRIS is a personnal project I've been developing on my free time to train myself. The idea came from someone who complained that most of mobile Tetris games were full of ads, so I decided to do one to train.

The game is based on a tutorial by Zigurous on YouTube. It's a simple and basic version of the game, with a linear difficulty (neither well dosed nor tested) and a single gamemode. The game was little tested so there are likely bugs.

This Github has only one commit as the other ones were made on PlasticSCM. I share it because I don't plan on publishing it, and thought it might be useful to other people. The code is not especially optimized or consistent, but was made in a few hours.
